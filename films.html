    <h1>The Godfather I</h1>
    <a href="https://en.0wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather">Learn More</a>
    <p>
        The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy,
        based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name.
    </p>It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family.
    <p>The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on
        the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
    </p>Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity.
    <p>Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position.
    </p>They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael.
    <p>Filming took place on location, primarily around New York and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule.
    </p>The musical score was principally composed by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.
    <p>The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972[5] and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made.
    </p>It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola).
    <p>Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall (Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola
        for Best Director.

    <h1>The Godfather II</h1>
    <a href="https://en.0wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II">Learn More</a>
    <p>
        The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a
        screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Partially based on Puzo's 1969
        novel The Godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel dramas: one picks
        up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone (Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone crime family, protecting the family
        business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone
        played by De Niro, from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Godfather Part II opened to divided reviews from critics. Its reputation, however, improved rapidly and it
        soon became the subject of critical reevaluation. It was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and became the
        first sequel to win for Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting
        Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor
        and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
    </p>
    <p>Both The Godfather Part II and its predecessor remain highly influential films, especially in the gangster genre,
        and the former has been reevaluated. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in
        American film history and it retained this position 10 years later.[4] Some have deemed it superior to the 1972
        original.[5] It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in
        1993, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant
